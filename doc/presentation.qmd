## Introduction

Intro to the class and tidyverse

Intro to selected dataframe and to research questions (explaining what information our dataset contains and what we are interested in researching. Slide should end with concrete research questions)

## Materials and Methods

Flowchart(quick explanation on how we plan to answer research questions)

## Data Cleaning and Augmentation

Data clean and data augmentation part(how we perform data cleaning and augmentation part and what we create also keep in mind biological perspective that influences our research questions)

## Data Cleaning and Augmentation

### Data Cleaning
We ensured data integrity by performing comprehensive data cleaning, which included:

1. **Removing Missing Values**
   - Ensured dataset completeness.
   - Code snippet:
     ```R
     df_cleaned <- df |> drop_na()
     ```
   - Outcome: No missing values found.

2. **Verifying Data Types**
   - Confirmed each variable's type for consistency.
   - Code snippet:
     ```R
     column_types <- df_cleaned |> summarise(across(everything(), class))
     ```
   - Outcome: All variables confirmed as numeric.

3. **Filtering Out Incorrect Values**
   - Ensured all values fell within expected ranges.
   - Code snippet:
     ```R
     df_cleaned <- df_cleaned |> filter(Diabetes_binary %in% c(0, 1, 2), ...)
     ```
   - Outcome: No out-of-range values detected.
