## Introduction

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
`Tidyverse`: enhances data manipulation and visualization with a tidy data workflow, fostering code that is

::: incremental
-   `readable`
-   `maintainable`
-   `reproducible`
-   `Core packages` ggplot2, dplyr, tidyr, readr, broom

::: {.column .incremental width="50%"}
#### `Our Dataset`

**Source**: Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) 2015.

**Key Features**: Health indicators related to diabetes, including:

::: incremental
-   lifestyle factors
-   health outcomes
-   demographic information

## Introduction

### Research Questions

1.  What are the key `predictive variables` in diabetes prognosis?

2.  How does `gender` influence the manifestation and progression of diabetes?

## Materials and Methods

## Data Cleaning and Augmentation

```{=html}
<style>
.small-font {
  font-size: 0.8em;
}
</style>
```
::: columns
::: {.column .small-font width="50%"}
### Data Cleaning

-   **Removed Missing Values**: `df_cleaned <- df |> drop_na()`

-   **Verified Data Types**: `column_types <- summarise(df_cleaned, across(everything(), class))`

-   **Filtered Incorrect Values**: Filtered out rows with values outside expected ranges.
:::

::: {.column .small-font width="50%"}
### Data Augmentation

-   **Transformed Variables**: Binary to categorical (e.g., `Smoker` to `Smoking Status`).

-   **Created New Variables**: E.g., `Habits`, `Health Risk`, based on lifestyle and health indicators.

-   **Socio-Economic Class**: Derived from income, education, and healthcare status.

## Data Analysis

<div style="display: flex; font-size: 0.8em;">

::: {style="flex: 1; padding-right: 10px;"}
### Correlation

-   **Between all variables**: health related variables correlated between them. Not highly negatively correlated variables.

-   **With the target variable**: GenHlth, HighBP and BMI most correlated with diabetes variable.

    </div>

    <div style="flex: 1; padding-left: 10px;">

### GLM

-   **All variables**: Creation of a GLM with all numerical variables.

-   **Step**: Step forward and backward for best variables selection.

-   **Results**: Lowest AIC achieved with backward model (contains 19 variables9.

### PCA + Logistic Regression

-   **Selected components**: 15 components that reach 80% of explained variability.

-   **Logistic regression**: Use of those components to perform a diabetes prediction model.

-   **Results**: Great accuracy with a value of 87%.

    </div>

    <div style="flex: 1; padding-left: 10px;">

### New GLMs

-   **Men VS. Women**: Creation of two different datasets according to sex.

-   **Results**: Better performance in Men model due to lowest AIC. More importance to general health variables and also to fruit variable. Much better performance than the GLM from first part of analysis.

-   Smoking status affects mostly the youngest age groups
-   Similar behavior for other age groups -\> smoking does not influence so significantly people over 35 years
-   BMI tends to increase over the age

-   Among Healthy individuals, more women have healthier habits
-   More women have an Average lifestyle than men in the non-diabetic cases, opposite for the diabetic counterparts.
-   Women in the non-diabetic group doubled from the Average to the Healthy group, not an important change for men
-   Among non-diabetic men, the Healthy cases were nearly 2000 more than the Average ones.
