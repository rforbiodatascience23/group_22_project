## Introduction

Intro to the class and tidyverse

Intro to selected dataframe and to research questions (explaining what information our dataset contains and what we are interested in researching. Slide should end with concrete research questions)

## Introduction

### Tidyverse and Data Exploration

`Tidyverse`: Collection of R packages for data manipulation, exploration and visualization. It supports a tidy data workflow making our code more:

-   readable

-   maintainable

-   reproducible

The core packages within the tidyverse include ggplot2, dplyr, tidyr, readr

### Our Dataset

## Data Cleaning and Augmentation

<div style="display: flex; font-size: 0.8em;">

::: {style="flex: 1; padding-right: 10px;"}
### Data Cleaning

-   **Removed Missing Values**: `df_cleaned <- df |> drop_na()`

-   **Verified Data Types**: `column_types <- summarise(df_cleaned, across(everything(), class))`

-   **Filtered Incorrect Values**: Filtered out rows with values outside expected ranges.

    </div>

    <div style="flex: 1; padding-left: 10px;">

### Data Augmentation

-   **Transformed Variables**: Binary to categorical (e.g., `Smoker` to `Smoking Status`).

-   **Created New Variables**: E.g., `Habits`, `Health Risk`, based on lifestyle and health indicators.

-   **Socio-Economic Class**: Derived from income, education, and healthcare status.
