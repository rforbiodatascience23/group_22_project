## Load libraries and data

```{r}
library("tidyverse")
df_cleaned <- read.table(file = "../data/02_dat_clean.tsv", sep = "\t", header = TRUE)
```

## Rename binary variables

Changing the smokers variable from binary format to categorical. The value "0" which indicates non-smokers is changed to "Non-Smoker", and the value "1" changed to "Smoker" respectively.

```{r}
df_cleaned <-
  df_cleaned |> 
  mutate(Smoker = case_when(
    Smoker == 0 ~ "Non-Smoker",
    Smoker == 1 ~ "Smoker"
  ))
```
