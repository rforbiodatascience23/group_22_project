## Adding new variables

### Habits

One variable that should be added is habits, a categorical variable that describes whether the lifestyle of the individual is healthy or not. This depends on many variables, namely Smoking, Alcohol consumption, Fruits and Veggies consumption and Physical Activity. For the first 2, we assigned -1 point, while for the latter 3, we assigned +1 respectively. A high score indicates a healthy lifestyle, a medium one indicates an average lifestyle, while a low score indicates an unhealthy one.

```{r}
df_cleaned <-
  df_cleaned |> 
  mutate(Habit_Score = Veggies + Fruits + PhysActivity - Smoker - HvyAlcoholConsump) |> 
  mutate(Habits = case_when(
    Habit_Score < 0 ~ "Unhealthy",
    Habit_Score >= 0 & Habit_Score < 2 ~ "Average",
    Habit_Score >= 2 ~ "Healthy"
  ))
```
