## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
1 + 1
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
data("diabetes_binary_5050split_health_indicators_BRFSS2015")
diabetes_binary_5050split_health_indicators_BRFSS2015
```

```{r}
data <- read_csv(file = "data/diabetes_binary_5050split_health_indicators_BRFSS2015.csv")
data
```

```{r}
library(readr)
diabetes_binary_5050split_health_indicators_BRFSS2015 <- read_csv("~/projects/group_22_project/data/diabetes_binary_5050split_health_indicators_BRFSS2015.csv")
show_col_types = FALSE
diabetes_binary_5050split_health_indicators_BRFSS2015
```
